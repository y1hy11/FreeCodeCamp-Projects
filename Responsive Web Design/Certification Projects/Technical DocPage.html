           <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.</p>

      <header>Variables </header>
      <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

A Python identifier must start with a letter or underscore (_); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because Python is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
You can use Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <p>
        Declaring variables in Python is a way to store a value in a named location. Here are some examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Example 1: Declaring a single variable
         <code>x = 5</code>
          In this example, x is the variable name, and 5 is the value assigned to it. You can then use x in your code to refer to the value 5.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example 2: Declaring multiple variables
        <code>x, y, z = 1, 2, 3</code>
         This is equivalent to declaring each variable separately:
        <code>x = 1 <br> y = 2 <br> z = 3</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Example 3: Declaring variables with different data types
        <code>name = "John"  # string <br> age = 30  # integer <br> height = 1.75  # float <br> is_admin = True  # boolean </code><br>
        In this example, we declare four variables with different data types: name is a string, age is an integer, height is a float, and is_admin is a boolean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example 4: Declaring variables with assignment operators
        <code>x = 5 x += 2  # x is now 7 <br> x -= 1  # x is now 6 <br> x *= 2  # x is now 12 <br> x /= 2  # x is now 6.0</code>
        In this example, we use assignment operators to modify the value of x. The += operator adds 2 to x, the -= operator subtracts 1 from x, the *= operator multiplies x by 2, and the /= operator divides x by 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example 5: Declaring variables with string formatting
        <code>name = "John" <br> age = 30 <br> greeting = "Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old." <br> print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.</code>
        In this example, we use string formatting to create a greeting message that includes the values of name and age.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example 6: Declaring variables with list and dictionary
        <code>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] <br> person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}</code>
        In this example, we declare two variables: fruits is a list of strings, and person is a dictionary with three key-value pairs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example 7: Declaring variables with tuple
        <code>coordinates = (40.7128, -74.0060)</code>
        In this example, we declare a variable coordinates with a tuple value.
      </li>
    </ul>
These are just a few examples of how you can declare variables in Python. Remember to always use meaningful variable names and follow the PEP 8 style guide for naming conventions.

     <header>Data Types in Python</header>
     <p>In Python, a data type is a classification of data that determines the type of value a variable can hold, the operations that can be performed on it, and the amount of memory it occupies. Python has several built-in data types, which can be categorized into several groups:
     <header>Numeric Types</header>
       <ul>
         <li>Integers (int): Whole numbers, e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.</li>
         <li>Floating Point Numbers (float): Decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.5, etc.</li>
         <li>Complex Numbers (complex): Numbers with real and imaginary parts, e.g., 3+4j, -2-3j, etc</li>
           Example
          <code>
          x = 5  # integer
          y = 3.14  # float
          z = 3 + 4j  # complex
          </code>
      </ul>
     <header>Sequence Types</header>
      <ul>
        <li>Strings (str): A sequence of characters, e.g., "hello", 'hello', etc. Strings can be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes.
        <li>Lists (list): A collection of items that can be of any data type, e.g., [1, 2, 3], ["a", "b", "c"], etc.
</li>
        <li>Tuples (tuple): A collection of items that cannot be changed, e.g., (1, 2, 3), ("a", "b", "c"), etc.</li>
</li>
      </ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
